          <p>
            <b>Subhas Chandra Bose </b> 23 January 1897 – 18 August 1945 
            was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British authority in India made him a hero among Indians,
            but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism,
            anti-Semitism,and military failure.The honorific Netaji (Hindustani: "Respected Leader") was 
            first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian soldiers of the Indische Legion 
            and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India in Berlin. It is now used 
            throughout India.Subhas Bose was born into wealth and privilege in a large Bengali family in Orissa during the British Raj.
            The early recipient of an Anglocentric education, he was sent after college to England to take the Indian 
            Civil Service examination.

            <h3>Ideology</h3>
            <p>
                Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a great source of inspiration for the struggle
                against the British.Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his 
                emphasis on social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days.
                The fresh interpretation of India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him.Some scholars 
                think that Hindu spirituality formed an essential part of his political and social thought.As historian
                Leonard Gordon explains "Inner religious explorations continued to be a part of his adult life. This set
                him apart from the slowly growing number of atheistic socialists and communists who dotted the Indian 
                landscape.

                His most famous quote was "Give me blood and I will give you freedom".Another famous quote was
                Dilli Chalo ("On to Delhi)!" This was the call he used to give the INA armies to motivate them. 
                Jai Hind, or, "Glory to India!" was another slogan used by him and later adopted by the Government of 
                India and the Indian Armed Forces. Another slogan coined by him was "Ittehad, Etemad, Qurbani" 
                (Urdu for "Unity, Agreement, Sacrifice").

           Bose was featured on the stamps in India from 1964, 1993, 1997, 2001, 2016, 2018 and 2021. 
           Bose was also featured in ₹2 coins in 1996 and 1997, ₹75 coin in 2018 and ₹125 coin in 2021. 
           Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport at Kolkata, Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Island, formerly 
           Ross Island and many other institutions in India are named after him. On 23 August 2007, 
           Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzō Abe visited the Subhas Chandra Bose memorial hall in Kolkata. 
           Abe, who is also the recipient of Netaji Award 2022,said to Bose's family "The Japanese are deeply moved
           by Bose's strong will to have led the Indian independence movement from British rule.
           Netaji is a much respected name in Japan."In 2021, the Government of India declared 23 January 
           as Parakram Divas to commemorate the birth anniversary of Subhas Chandra Bose. 
           Political party, Trinamool Congress and the All India Forward Bloc demanded that the day should be 
           observed as 'Deshprem Divas'.A holographic statue of Bose at the India Gate to mark his 
           125th birth anniversary was installed at India Gate and a permanent granite statue replaced the 
           holographic statue later.</p>
